##Updating the codebase

All the code for the popup panel is located in data/panel.html

To run the extension after changing code use:

```
jpm run

```
This is the jpm command to run a new instance of Firefox with your add-on installed.

If Firefox can not be located or you have installed Firefox Developer as an alternate browser, you may need to provide the path to it (example in Ubuntu):

```
jpm run -b /usr/bin/firefox

```
