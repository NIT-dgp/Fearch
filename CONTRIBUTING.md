HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
=================

chrome-search-extention is in its very early development stage, you can go over the issues on the github  
issues page and send in a PR.

your commits in the PR should be of the form:

```
shortlog: commit message

commit body

Fixes #21
```

1. **shortlog** is the area/filename where you make the change commit message is the very brief description  
 of the change made by you and any other additional details go into the commit body.

2. The **Fixes #<issue_no>** is the issue you are working on.

3. Use the **imperative mood** in the subject line  
   Imperative mood just means "spoken or written as if giving a command or instruction". A few examples:
   
- Add CONTRIBUTING.MD *instead* of Adding CONTRIBUTING.md
- Change the header text format *instead* of Changing the header text format
- Fix text box scaling *instead* of Fixing the text box scaling

The **commit body need not have imperative mood** you have independence to explain everything normally  
there.

Happy coding :)
